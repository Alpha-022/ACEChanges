### Compute Engine Machine Families

There are two new machine families:  **Storage Optimized** and  **GPU**

- **Storage Optimized (Z3) :** Machine types for storage-intensive workloads, like horizontal, scale-out databases.

- **GPU (N1) :** Graphics processing units (GPUs) accelerate specific workloads on your instances such as machine learning and data processing. 

## Slide no.  33
### Static IP Addresses - Remember

Not an error, just a simple typo. Instead of **an Static IP**, there should be **a Static IP**.


## Slide no. 39
### Committed use discounts

**Suggestion:** The slide mentions that "Up to 70% discount based on machine type and GPUs." This can be made clearer by saying: The discount is up to 55% for most resources, like machine types or GPUs. The discount is up to 70% for memory-optimized machine types.

**Source:** https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts

 - **Can be included in slide:**
	- Committed use discounts don't apply to preemptible VM instances, N1 shared-core machine types, or extended memory.


## Slide no. 52

## Slide no. 155
### GCP - Block Storage

There's new type of storage option called **Hyperdisk** available in block storage.
- The official documentation mentions: 
*Google Cloud Hyperdisk is Google's next generation block storage. By offloading and dynamically scaling out storage processing, it decouples storage performance from the VM type and size. Hyperdisk offers substantially higher performance, flexibility and efficiency when compared to Persistent Disk.*

### Object Versioning

The statement might need a revamp : Prevents accidental deletion & provides history.

**Factual error:**  Objects can only be recovered from a deleted bucket when  _soft delete is enabled_. Object Versioning  _does not_  provide protection against bucket deletions.

## Slide no. 205
### Cloud Storage - Static website

**Suggestion:**  While stating that "the bucket name should match the DNS name for the website," it's important to specify that this is only applicable if you are using a  ***custom domain***. If you're using the default Google Cloud Storage domain, this requirement does not apply.

## Slide no. 223

### Resource Hierarchy & IAM Policy

Please review the point: "You can't restrict policy at a lower level if permission is given at a higher level," as mentioned in the slide. I read that deny policies have higher priority.

## Slide no. 313
### Logging IAM Roles and Service Account Roles

**Factual error:** The **serviceAccountUser** role allows running tasks as a service account, but doesnâ€™t let users create or manage instances. *They need extra Compute Engine permissions for that.*
